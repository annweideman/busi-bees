# BUSI: Biostatistics Undergraduate Summer Internships at UNC-Chapel Hill

## Overview
Are your undergraduates looking for a way to stay “BUSI” over the summer? UNC-Chapel Hill has crafted the perfect template for you to launch a successful summer program that turns the theoretical world of statistics into hands-on, real-world experiences.

## Why We Started BUSI + Our Humble Beginnings
Dreamed up by a dynamic duo of grad students and a visionary faculty member, BUSI was born out of a coffee-fueled brainstorming session. The program's infrastructure is managed by graduate students while faculty members sponsor the opportunities.

## Application Process

### Finding Opportunities
Our faculty cook up the hottest summer projects ranging from the fundamentals of data management to publication-worthy analyses. Faculty detail their needs allowing our graduate student directors to matchmake them with a list of students tailored to the projects.

### Applying and Getting In
Interested students within the department fill out an application. Our graduate student directors review the applications and hand-pick 3-5 standout candidates for each faculty member.

### Interviews
Faculty interview and choose their intern(s) from the curated shortlist. Typically, each faculty member selects 1-2 students, although some have supported as many as 3 interns.

### Financial Support
Whether it’s through faculty grants or the sheer love of the game, students either receive financial support or volunteer their time in exchange for the experience.

## Summer Events
While faculty engage with their interns, the graduate student program directors are diligently orchestrating behind the scenes, organizing a summer kickoff event, presentation preparation workshops, 'Dress for Success' session, and an end-of-summer symposium.

## The Grand Finale

### Prep
Students attend a presentation preparation workshop hosted by the graduate student directors. Following the workshop, they receive poster templates which they complete and return to the directors for 1-2 rounds of constructive feedback.

### The Main Event
The symposium is the culmination of the summer experience for the students, where they showcase their posters both in-person and via Zoom while enjoying a delicious catered breakfast.

### Shine Bright
Our seasoned graduate students, equipped with a rubric, take on the role of judges and evaluate these presentations. Outstanding posters receive special recognition both via a certificate and shout-out in the school news.

## How BUSI Boosts Careers
A number of our interns continue to work on their research as an honors thesis or snag a permanent spot as a research assistant.

## Echoes from the Hallways – Student Feedback
Through a survey, interns are invited to evaluate each aspect of their research experience, outline their plans for continuing their research, and offer recommendations for improving BUSI. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

## Looking Ahead – Keeping the BUSI Buzz Alive

### Teaming Up with Dr. Monaco
We've joined forces with Dr. Jane Monaco, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Degree Programs, who is responsible for reaching out to faculty regarding possible projects.

### Funding of Graduate Student Directors
The Biostatistics Department, together with a seed grant from the ASA Section on Statistics and Data Science Education (SSDSE), provides essential funding for our graduate student program directors.

### Leadership Pipeline
Our "Directors in Training" program guarantees a seamless transition of the program into the next year. Leo Li and Shravani Chitineni are exemplary students who have also served as directors of this program.
