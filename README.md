# Are your undergraduates looking for a way to stay "BUSI" over the summer?
Is your Biostatistics department too quiet over the summer? Are your graduate students thirsty for opportunities to mentor budding statisticians? UNC-Chapel Hill has crafted the perfect template for you to launch a successful summer program.

## Why We Started BUSI

Dreamed up by a dynamic duo of grad students and a visionary faculty member, the Biostatistics Undergraduate Summer Internships (BUSI) program was born out of a coffee-fueled brainstorming session aimed at turning the theoretical world of statistics into hands-on, real-world experiences. The program's infrastructure is managed by graduate students while faculty members sponsor the opportunities.

## Application Process

### Finding Opportunities
Our faculty offer summer projects ranging from the fundamentals of data management to publication-worthy analyses. Faculty detail their needs allowing our graduate student directors to match them with a list of students tailored to their projects. Additionally, faculty specify if a graduate student mentor will be working directly with the intern(s).

### Applying and Getting In
Interested students within the department fill out an application. Our graduate student directors review the applications and hand-pick 3-5 standout candidates for each faculty member based on project needs.

### Interviews
Faculty interview and choose their intern(s) from the curated shortlist. Typically, each faculty member selects 1-2 students.

### Financial Support
BUSI encourages faculty to offer any opportunities that will work well for undergraduate students. Some projects are funded while others are volunteer-based. Faculty indicate funding availability when offering projects and students indicate if they are only interested in funded opportunities or any type of experience in their application.

## Summer Events
While faculty engage with their interns, the graduate student program directors are diligently orchestrating behind the scenes, organizing a summer kickoff event, graduate student mentor training session, presentation preparation workshops, 'Dress for Success' session, and an end-of-summer research symposium.

## The Grand Finale: End-of-Summer Research Symposium
### Training & Preparation
Students attend a presentation preparation workshop hosted by the graduate student directors. Following the workshop, they receive poster templates which they complete and return to the directors for 1-2 rounds of constructive feedback.

### The Main Event
The symposium is the culmination of the summer experience where students showcase their posters while nibbling on a delicious catered breakfast. It’s a feast for the mind and the belly!

### Shine Bright
Seasoned volunteer graduate students equipped with a rubric take on the role of judges and evaluate student posters and presentations. Outstanding posters receive special recognition both via a certificate and shout-out in the school news.

## How BUSI Boosts Careers
A number of our interns continue to work on their research as an honors thesis or snag a permanent spot as a research assistant.

## Echoes from the Hallways – Student Feedback
Through a survey, interns are invited to evaluate each aspect of their research experience, outline their plans for continuing their research, and offer recommendations for improving BUSI. The feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive; the interns complete the program energized and eager to continue their research well beyond the summer.

## Looking Ahead – Keeping the BUSI Buzz Alive
### Teaming Up with Dr. Monaco
We've joined forces with Dr. Jane Monaco, the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Degree Programs, who reaches out to faculty to solicit projects.

### Funding of Graduate Student Directors
The Biostatistics Department, together with a seed grant from the ASA Section on Statistics and Data Science Education (SSDSE), provides essential funding for our graduate student program directors and symposium.

### Leadership Pipeline
Our "Directors in Training" program guarantees a seamless transition of the program into the next year. Exceptional graduate students Leo Li and Shravani Chitineni have served as directors in training.
