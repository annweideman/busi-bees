# Biostatistics Undergraduate Summer Internships (BUSI) Program

## Overview

The BUSI program at UNC-Chapel Hill was conceived by a dynamic duo of graduate students and a visionary faculty member during a coffee-fueled brainstorming session. It aims to turn theoretical knowledge of statistics into hands-on, real-world experiences.

## Why We Started BUSI

The program's infrastructure is managed by graduate students, with faculty members sponsoring the opportunities, aimed at making the Biostatistics department lively during the summer and providing mentoring opportunities for graduate students.

## Application Process

### Finding Opportunities

- Faculty offer projects ranging from data management fundamentals to publication-worthy analyses.
- Faculty specify their needs which allows graduate student directors to match them with students tailored to these projects.

### Applying and Getting In

- Students within the department submit an application.
- Graduate student directors review the applications and select 3-5 candidates per faculty member based on project needs.

### Interviews

- Faculty interview and select their interns from a curated shortlist, typically choosing 1-2 students.

## Financial Support

- Some projects are funded while others are volunteer-based.
- Faculty and students indicate their funding preferences during the application process.

## Summer Events

Organized by graduate student program directors, the events include:

- A summer kickoff event
- Graduate student mentor training session
- Presentation preparation workshops
- "Dress for Success" session
- End-of-summer research symposium

## The Grand Finale: End-of-Summer Research Symposium

- **Training & Preparation:** Students attend a workshop, receive poster templates, and submit their completed posters for feedback.
- **The Main Event:** Showcases student posters with a delicious catered breakfast.
- **Shine Bright:** Volunteer graduate students judge the posters, with outstanding work receiving special recognition.

## How BUSI Boosts Careers

Many interns continue their research as an honors thesis or secure a permanent position as a research assistant.

## Echoes from the Hallways – Student Feedback

Through surveys, interns evaluate their research experience, outline their future plans, and suggest improvements. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

## Looking Ahead – Keeping the BUSI Buzz Alive

### Teaming Up with Dr. Jane Monaco

- Dr. Monaco, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Degree Programs, helps solicit projects for the program.

### Funding of Graduate Student Directors

- Supported by the Biostatistics Department and a seed grant from the ASA Section on Statistics and Data Science Education (SSDSE).

### Leadership Pipeline

- Our "Directors in Training" program ensures seamless transition with leadership from exceptional graduate students.
